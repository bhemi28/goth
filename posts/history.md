# Hello World! I'm Meet Bhesaniya

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a **Backend Developer** based in **Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India**, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Engineering at Silver Oak University (graduating June 2026).

## What I Do

I'm a backend developer with **1.5 years of hands-on experience** in production systems, APIs, and internal tools. My daily work involves:

- Building reliable, scalable backend services
- Designing APIs with robust validation and error handling
- Working with relational and NoSQL databases
- Debugging production issues and improving system reliability

Currently, I'm working as a **Backend Developer Intern** at **Ordex Technology Solutions LLP**, where I've been contributing since August 2024.

## My Tech Stack

### Languages & Frameworks
- **Golang** - My primary focus and where I'm heading
- **Node.js (Express.js)** - Production experience

### Databases
- **MySQL 8.x** - Schema design, indexing, query optimization
- **MongoDB** - Aggregation pipelines, flexible schemas

### APIs & Architecture
- REST APIs
- GraphQL (Shopify Admin API)
- Webhooks
- Pagination patterns

### DevOps & Tools
- Docker (building & containerization)
- Git
- Linux (Debian-based)
- Single-service deployment (Render, Fly.io)

## What I've Built at Ordex

At Ordex, I've been working on some interesting challenges:

- **Shopify Admin GraphQL Integration** - Built production workflows for product, group, and seasonal fundraising features
- **Robust API Design** - Implemented request validation, consistent state transitions, and predictable edge-case handling
- **Transaction-like Flows** - Designed operations coordinating multiple dependent services with atomicity and safe failure recovery
- **Production Debugging** - Handled partial updates, retries, and API failures; supported post-deployment incidents

## Side Projects

When I'm not at work, I'm usually building something:

### Product Price Tracker
A backend service for tracking price/availability changes across e-commerce platforms.
- **Tech:** Golang, MongoDB
- Designed authentication and product management APIs
- Migrated from SQL to MongoDB for flexible schemas
- *Roadmap:* Web scraping workers, trigger-based alerts, notifications

### RSS Feed Aggregator
A service for ingesting, storing, and serving RSS feed data.
- **Tech:** Golang, MySQL
- User authentication and subscription management
- Focus on relational schema design and query optimization

### Go TUI Logger (In Progress)
A terminal-based app for daily activity tracking.
- Exploring Go TUI libraries and terminal UX patterns
- Personal tool to deepen non-web Go development

## My Journey & Philosophy

I started my journey like many developers - curious about how things work under the hood. What drew me to backend development was the challenge of building systems that are:

- **Reliable** - They work when users need them
- **Scalable** - They grow with demand
- **Maintainable** - Future developers (including future me) can understand them

I'm particularly focused on **data integrity** and **edge-case handling**. The boring stuff that prevents 3 AM production incidents.

## Why Golang?

I'm actively **transitioning toward Golang-centric backend development**. Here's why:

```go
// It's simple
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}

// It's fast
// Compiles to a single binary
// No runtime dependencies

// It's explicit
// Errors are values, not exceptions
// You handle them or you don't compile
```

Go's philosophy of simplicity and explicitness resonates with how I think about software. No magic, no hidden behavior, just clear code that does what it says.
